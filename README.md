# CS471 Assignments Builder

This repository contains code referenced by the `Builder` homework assignment, 
aimed at gaining hands-on experience with:
- the [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) build tool
- handling external libraries/dependencies (e.g., [gson](https://github.com/google/gson))
- parsing [JSON](https://www.json.org/) files

Specifically, without making any changes to the code in the [src/](src/) folder,
how can you make the code compile and run successfully?
